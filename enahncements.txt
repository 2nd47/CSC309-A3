I think there are a few things that make the webpage worthy of a mark higher
than that awarded for minimally meeting specification.

These include:

- Sticky header: will stay in place to quickly access a different example
- Footer page instructions link: instead of having the instructions statically
  in the page I chose to also include them as a separate AJAX call which also
  loads an HTML served by the server to display instructions
- Detailed article input box: It is styled to match the header and works fluidly
  with the rest of the website
- Blur on hover for thumbnail articles: Adding a blur over thumbnails gives the
  user a simple way to know that they are selecting the correct content
- Article title pop-up on hover: Dynamically pops up titles as you hover over
  articles in thumbnail view
